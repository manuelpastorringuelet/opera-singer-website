        {`    The soprano Taryn Knerr, hailing from Wisconsin (USA), lives as a freelance musician in Leipzig. Her first stage experiences were gathered in Milwaukee, and after she came to Germany, in productions at the Theater Gera/Altenburg. Her stylistic range extends from the Baroque, such as the role of Sestilio in Mario fuggitivo (Alte Musik Fest Leipzig), to modern works, like the role of Nancy in Benjamin Britten's Albert Herring (directed by Jasmin Solfaghari). In the summer of 2013, she was invited to Greece to perform as Despina in Mozart's Così fan tutte, directed by Dirk Schattner. In May 2017, she worked at the Cologne Opera in Das Lied von der Frauen vom Fluß under the direction of Howard Arman (directed by Carlus Padrissa – La Fura dels Baus). In 2019, she sang as Ernestine and Alexis in a Pamy production of Offenbach's one-act operettas "Die Insel Tulipatan" and "Herr Blumenkohl gibt sich die Ehre" (Salon Pitzelberger) at the Volksbühne am Rudolfplatz in Cologne. In March 2022, she appeared in a production of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro as Susanna. She regularly collaborates with the Musical Comedy of the Leipzig Opera as part of the music festival "Klassik für Kinder" – most recently as Sleeping Beauty in Humperdinck's opera of the same name. Among her upcoming engagements is her participation in a Pamy production of Wagner's Parsifal.`}

        {`Her repertoire includes oratorios and masses by, among others, Bach, Brahms, Dvorak, Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Pergolesi, and Fauré. Taryn Knerr is also in demand on the concert stage. She recently performed at the opening concert of the Festwochen der Alten Musik Innsbruck, with the Camerata Salzburg in Salzburg (music by Assmayr and Schubert), with the Wuppertal Symphony Orchestra (music by Vivaldi and Mendelssohn), and at the Bachfest Leipzig in the Nikolaikirche. After successfully completing two degrees in Mathematics and German Studies in the USA, she completed her vocal studies at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy Leipzig. She received various scholarships (including a Fulbright Scholarship, Calvin College Vocal Scholarship, and the ad infinitum Scholarship). Masterclasses with John Norris, Philip Moll, and Claude Webster provided her with important and inspiring impulses for technique and interpretation.`}
